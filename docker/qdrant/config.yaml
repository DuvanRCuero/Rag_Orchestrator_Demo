    # Real amount of segments may vary depending on multiple parameters:
    #  - Amount of stored points
    #  - Current write RPS

    # Do not create segments larger than this size (in KiloBytes).
    # Large segments might require disproportionately long indexation times,

    # If indexation speed is more important - make this parameter lower.
    # If search speed is more important - make this parameter higher.
